# SSD-based Object Detection in PyTorch

This repo implements [SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) in PyTorch for object detection, using MobileNet backbones.  It also has out-of-box support for retraining on Google Open Images dataset and Pascal VOC.  

For documentation, please refer to the following:
