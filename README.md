# Single Shot MultiBox Detector Implementation in Pytorch

This repo implements [SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325), using MobileNet backbones.  It also has out-of-box support for retraining on Google Open Images dataset.

Thanks to @qfgaohao for the upstream implementation:  [https://github.com/qfgaohao/pytorch-ssd](https://github.com/qfgaohao/pytorch-ssd)
