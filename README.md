# SSD-based Object Detection in Pytorch

This repo implements [SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) in PyTorch for object detection, using MobileNet backbones.  It also has out-of-box support for retraining on Google Open Images dataset.  

> For documentation, please refer to Object Detection portion of the **[Hello AI World](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/tree/dev#training)** tutorial:
